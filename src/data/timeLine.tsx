    desc: "Pre-seed, or 'friends and family' funding, is the initial step toward getting enough capital to develop a product. Since pre-seed money is the earliest part of the fundraising journey, few startups manage to secure capital at this stage. Most entrepreneurs in this situation have yet to get a product to market and may not have anything more than a prototype, which makes it difficult to convince pre-seed investors to bet their hard-earned money on an idea that hasn't been fully completed yet. In most cases, pre-seed capital  comes in the form of convertible security. It begins as a loan, and when certain growth conditions are met, the loan turns into a certain amount of equity.",

To expand, you'll likely need a much larger capital investment than earlier ones. Series B funding differs from Series A. Whereas Series A investors will measure your potential, for Series B they want to see actual performance and evidence of a commercially viable product or service to support future fundraising. Performance metrics give investors confidence that you and your advisors can achieve success at a larger scale.",
