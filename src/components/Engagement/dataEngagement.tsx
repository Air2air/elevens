This is where you should be as descriptive as possible so as not to miss out on any crucial steps.A key element in the SOW, a schedule is a project timeline including milestones, tasks, and resources throughout the project's lifecycle. Depending on the type of engagement you're in, the schedule can be left until a later point. For example, if retainer agreements are used and you're delivering services on an on-going basis, there will be less paperwork and, consequently, the schedule could be excluded. ",
