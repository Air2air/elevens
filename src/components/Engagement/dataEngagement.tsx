It's essentially when the milestones are scoped out for the project. Not necessarily on a task level yet, but enough to align goals and expectations between the agency and the client. Key takeaway: Set up the scope based on previously defined project requirements. What is in, and what is out of scope? Specify milestones and align with the client.",

Specifying duration and billable hours for each milestone will help you predict the end date of the project. Tasks are clear-cut activities to achieve milestones and general steps outlined in the scope of work. This is where you should be as descriptive as possible so as not to miss out on any crucial steps.A key element in the SOW, a schedule is a project timeline including milestones, tasks, and resources throughout the project's lifecycle. Depending on the type of engagement you're in, the schedule can be left until a later point. For example, if retainer agreements are used and you're delivering services on an on-going basis, there will be less paperwork and, consequently, the schedule could be excluded. ",
