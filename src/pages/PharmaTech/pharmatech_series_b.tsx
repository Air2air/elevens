To expand, you'll likely need a much larger capital investment than earlier ones. Series B funding differs from Series A. Whereas Series A investors will measure your potential, for Series B they want to see actual performance and evidence of a commercially viable product or service to support future fundraising. Performance metrics give investors confidence that you and your team can achieve success at a larger scale.Â `;
